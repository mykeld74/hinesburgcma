	<p class="pageSectionText">
		Thanks for taking the time to consider membership here at Community Alliance Church. We are a
		group of Christians from all walks of life, committed to sharing our lives together in Christ
		and making disciples of Jesus, as a team.
	</p>
	<p class="pageSectionText">
		We don't want to just <em>go</em> to church, we want to <em>be</em> the church. A church for
		real life. We talk about real issues and real life situations to help us live as a people of
		<em>real hope</em> in a very chaotic and confused world.
	</p>
	<h3>What's different about this place?</h3>
	<p class="pageSectionText">
		Our vision is to <em>"reach the world for Jesus one person at a time."</em> In short, we believe
		that every member of the church has an important role to play in God's plan - not just the pastors,
		teachers and leaders. Together, we CAN make a real-life difference!
