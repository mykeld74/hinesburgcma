		We believe the Bible teaches that those who have responded to the message of the gospel,
		repented, and confessed Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, should then be baptized by water as an
		act of obedience as a new disciple of Jesus. In the book of <a
			href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A38-39&version=NIV">Acts</a
		>, baptism was an immediate response for those who accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
		Baptism by immersion is symbolic of the death of one's old life, then the resurrection to a new
		life following Jesus.
