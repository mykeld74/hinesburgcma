		<p class="pageSectionText">
			Hinesburg's GTCG are located in the sunny, northeast area of the CAC campus. The GTCG program
			is a collaboration among Community Alliance Church, the Garden's Coordination Team and the <a
				href="https://www.uvm.edu/extension/mastergardener/extension-master-gardener-program"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">UVM Extension's Master Gardener Program</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p class="pageSectionText">
			Ideas for the project began in 2008, when a team from CAC returned home from a mission trip to
			Louisiana, where volunteers served following Hurricane Katrina. Impressed by the commitment to
			rebuild communities in the New Orleans area, the mission group returned home inspired to make
			a difference in their own community. In 2010, the first 16 gardeners from Hinesburg partnered
			with volunteers from CAC to begin preparing the first beds.
		</p>
		<p class="pageSectionText">
			Now 40 beds large, the mission of the GTCG is as follows: <em
				>to provide and maintain the Growing Together Community Garden space with and for local
				residents who want to grow their own carefully tended, organic vegetables and flowers for
				friends, family and neighbors.</em
