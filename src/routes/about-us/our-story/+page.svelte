		<h2 class="pageSectionTitle">Our Why</h2>
		<p class="pageSectionText">
			Most people live disconnected from God, His family, and their purpose. We exist to invite
			people into our family, in this life and the next. We do this by asking Jesus to saturate our
			lives, our families, and our communities with His love. As He does this, Vermont becomes a
			little more like heaven each day.
