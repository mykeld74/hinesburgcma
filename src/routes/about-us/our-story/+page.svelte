			God hates loneliness! That’s why Jesus is at work in the world rescuing and restoring all of
			creation – including us! Life is filled with overwhelming circumstances and lots of questions
			like, <em
				>"How do I deal with my fears, my insecurities, my anxiety and the darkness that steals my
				joy?"</em
			>
			Whether it's financial issues, relationship issues, or spiritual issues - Jesus has the answer:
			It’s all about <strong>REAL</strong> life with <strong>REAL</strong> people in
			<strong>TRUE</strong>
			community. That’s our <strong>HOPE</strong> for you!
			<em
				>"Christ in you, the <strong>HOPE</strong>
				of glory."</em

		<h2 class="pageSectionTitle">Our Why</h2>
		<p class="pageSectionText">
			Most people live disconnected from God, His family, and their purpose. We exist to invite
			people into our family, in this life and the next. We do this by asking Jesus to saturate our
			lives, our families, and our communities with His love. As He does this, Vermont becomes a
			little more like heaven each day.
