		Attending church on a Sunday morning to worship as a full congregation is a wonderful and vital
		part of the Christian faith. However, getting to know others on a personal level and developing
		real friendships is far more fruitful when done through involvement in smaller groups. At CAC,
		there are myriad opportunities to join with other adults who share your interests and faith
		goals. We have groups for men, groups for women, and co-ed groups. Some groups meet in someone's
		home to share a meal and then do a Bible study, while some groups meet out at a restaurant for a
		quick devotional during the workday. Some groups meet for years on a regular basis, while others
		gather for certain events or when a particular need arises. Whatever the situation, adult
		ministries at CAC exist to provide each person with opportunities to <em>live life</em> with
		others in our church family. By <em>living life together</em>, we mean that we have developed
		relationships through which we know about and participate in what's happening in one another's
		lives, homes and hearts. Please read on for information on some of the adult ministries at CAC!

	<p class="pageSectionText">
		Men's Ministry at CAC exists to encourage and support our fellow man in his pursuit of Christ.
		We meet twice a month for our Men's Group, during which we eat dinner together, discuss what's
		going on in our lives, study the Bible and pray. Outside of this bi-monthly meeting time, we
		also do service projects and other activities to allow us to live out our faith. Ultimately, we
		seek to live the life God has intended for each of us.

	<h2 class="pageSectionTitle">Women's Ministry</h2>
	<p class="pageSectionText">
		Women's Ministry at CAC exists to provide opportunites for women to find a place where they can
		connect with other women, to find hope and help in all of life. Whether it's through different
		women's groups or Bible studies, intentional small group gatherings, special events and service
		opportunities, our goal is to grow together. Our hope is that women will develop deep
		relationships with each other, grow in their faith in Jesus and find a place of true acceptance
		and love that will help them go out and offer the same to those around them.

	<h2 class="pageSectionTitle">Small Groups</h2>
	<p class="pageSectionText">
		CAC Small Groups (SGs) are an opportunity to practice following Jesus in smaller groups that
		meet regularly to study, share, and serve with each other. The schedule, venue and focus vary by
		group. The intention of SGs is to build each other up in ways that are best done in a setting of
		several people, as opposed to a full congregation. The goal of SGs is to see each other grow in
		faith, while building solid, authentic relationships that last a lifetime.
	</p>
	<p class="pageSectionText">
		To learn more about SGs, contact Ray Bulaga, co-coordinator of our Small Group team, at
		802-598-5027. You can also learn more about all of our active Small Groups here. Or, you can
		always ask anyone you know at CAC - almost all of us are involved in a Small Group!
