				> is a Bible-centered ministry that works with local churches to launch and host chapters that
				equip parents with a deeper understanding of the Christian worldview and apologetics (how to
				make a case for and defend the truth of Christianity). Our passion is to help close the "GAP"
				that exists for parents between knowing the world will challenge their kids' faith and knowing
				what to do about it.
